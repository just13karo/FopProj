Iterpreter For Python


To begin working on our project we wrote python coddes needed for this project. onece we had certain idea about python syntax,
we tryed to understand how it could have been implimented in java.
we crated seperate functions tahat would help us evaluate given progrram , we worked on seperate codes, but we worked togeter which means we know what each 
one of us was doing. after we had our impimenter at certain level we started runing given python codes, and through trail and error it helpd us understand more what needed to be changed in our codes, what needed to be added, or how we could improve it.
after working we started uploading oure finished codes and perfecting our implimentor, we made shure tahat all algorithms run proplerly and uploaded thoes algorithms.
